# Renyi ADAPT

This package is meant to faciliate variational optimization of the Renyi divergence,
    builiding the ansatz with ADAPT.

## Software Framework

This package is largely an extension of `ADAPT.jl`, hosted here: https://github.com/kmsherbertvt/ADAPT.jl

Most of the "library" code that needs to be written will be implementing functions defined in that module.

The `ADAPT.jl` package is organized around the following types:
- `Ansatz`
- `Generator`
- `Observable`
- `QuantumState`
- `AdaptProtocol`
- `OptimizationProtocol`

The first two (`Ansatz` and `Generator`) represent a sequence of `exp(iÎ¸H)` rotations,
    where `H` is a Hermitian operator.
The "standard" implementation in `ADAPT.jl` uses Pauli decompositions,
    and that should work just fine for us, so we needn't worry about these.

The latter two (`AdaptProtocol` and `OptimizationProtocol`) are just "enum" classes
    to identify the precise methods by which one grows and then optimizes the ansatz.
The "standard" implementations in `ADAPT.jl` should work fine for our purposes,
    at least until we know things are working and want to get fancy.

The middle two (`Observable` and `QuantumState`) are where most of the work needs to be done.
See the files `src/__density_matrices.jl` and `src/__renyi_divergence.jl`
    for a skeleton of what needs to be done
    (or at least as much of it as my foresight allows).

## Getting Started

In principle, if you have Julia installed,
    it should be able to automatically locate all additional dependencies and install them
    when you first precompile the package code.
This claim can be corroborated if you can execute the following commands without error:

1. Clone this repository, eg. via `git clone https://<the repository url>`
2. Change your working directory to the project directory now on your computer.
3. Start a Julia REPL, via the command `julia`.
4. Enter Julia's "Pkg" mode, by tapping the  `]` key.
5. Activate the project environment, via the command `activate .`.
6. Try to download all dependencies, via the command `instantiate`.
7. Try to precompile the package source code, via the command `precompile`.
8. Back out of "Pkg" mode by tapping the backspace key.
9. Try to run the demo script, via the command `include("demo.jl")`.

If you expect everything to work,
    you can skip steps 6 and 7,
    since all that stuff happens when the project package gets imported in the demo script,
    but if something goes wrong, it's helpful to keep track of where.
